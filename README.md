# Twitter-Bot-using-Tweepy
This program is a basic Twitter Bot created using Tweepy library that likes, retweets and responds to particular tweets when that twitter developer account, where the Application is created, is tagged and has a specific hashtag in the tweet.

**Software Requirements** : Python 3.7, [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy), Twitter Developer Account

**Description** : This twitter bot, when we run the program, likes, retweets and responds to those tweets that have mentioned or tagged that developer account with a hashtag (#hi, #hello,...) with a simple "Hi There!" text. When the tweet has a hashtag "#hi/#hello/#hey", the bot will respond as "#Hi there". If the tweet has two hashtags, like "#Hey #WhatsUp", the bot will respond as "#Hi there, All Good!". It will also retweet and like those tweets. This process will be done in an automated way by the Twitter Bot.

**Note** : For creating this project, a twitter developer account is needed. First, you need to create a Twitter account and then apply for a [Twitter Developer acoount](https://developer.twitter.com/en)
